Notes for what to do:
    - What is the party of the people running for re-election? 
    - What is the proportion of people staying or new?
    - occupation of donors? Ranked occupations of democrats and republicans
        - group by party
        - Merge candidate and contribution, by contributor because then we can equal their id to their name and party
        - Then sort by party
        - Group by occupation 
        - Sum up the rows of each occupation
        - Arrange by the greatest number of rows
